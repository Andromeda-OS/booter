# Andromeda/PureDarwin Booter

This repository contains the code needed to boot PureDarwin to the point where the kernel can run.
Originally intended for use with the [Andromeda kernel](https://github.com/Andromeda-OS/Kernel), it
has since been modified for use with the [PureDarwin project](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin).
The last version fully compatible with the Andromeda kernel is available [at commit `c3d049e`](https://github.com/Andromeda-OS/booter/commit/c3d049e96c2b2791cc12953f136b0e706460093f).
